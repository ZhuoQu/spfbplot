# spfbplot
Two visualization tools for sparse multivariate functional data

First of all, open import_spfbplot.R and run it. The sparse data can be fitted from "mFPCA.R", "multi_FPCA.R", and further improved by "bootstrap.R".

The sparse functional boxplot code is available in sparse_fbplot_construct.R, and the comments are at the top. 
If you want to obtain the sparse two-stage functional boxplot, outlier detection with directional outlyingness needs to be implemented with "DirOut.R" first.

The intensity sparse functional boxplot code is available in intensity_sparse_fbplot_construct.R, and the comments are at the top. 
If you want to obtain the intensity sparse two-stage functional boxplot, outlier detection with directional outlyingness needs to be implemented with "DirOut.R" first.
